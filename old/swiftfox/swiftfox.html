<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
Swift Fox is the programming language that allows to program logic specifying when and how
Fennec Fox stack should be reconfigured. Swift Fox is a compiler in itself, but before we
can use it we need to compile it from a source code.
</p>

<p>
Swift Fox source code relies on the following tools that should be avaivale in the system: lex and yacc.
Before we install Swift Fox, we need to install these tools. For example, in Ubuntu the same tools have different
names and can be installed in the following way:
</p>


<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install bison flex
</pre>

Then we can unpack the Swift Fox source code:

<pre>
$ tar -zxvf swiftfox.tar.gz
$ cd swiftfox
</pre>

and install it by running the install script

<pre>
$ ./install
</pre>

<h3>Compiler Architecture</h3>

<p>
Swift Fox compiler is written in C using Flex and Bison libraries. 
<a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/">Flex</a> is a tool for generating
lexical analyzers and it is an open version of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_%28software%29">lex</a>.
Bison is a parser generator and it is a GNU version of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">yacc</a>. 
The generated output of the Swift Fox program is nesC code.

<h3>Swift Fox Tutorial</h3>

<b>Syntax and Semantics</b>
Every Swift Fox (SF) program consists of the following sections:
<ul>
<li>Definition of configurations
<li>Definition of events
<li>Definition of policies
<li>Initial State
</ul>


<p>
At minimum, a SF program must include at least one configuration definition
and the initial state. For example, the code below specifies a configuration
<b>hello</b> and once started, it runs in this configuration.
</p>

<pre>
configuration hello { <b>blink(1, 1024)</b> # application
&#160;&#160;&#160;nothing # network
&#160;&#160;&#160;nothing # network addressing
&#160;&#160;&#160;nothing # qoi
&#160;&#160;&#160;nothing # mac
&#160;&#160;&#160;nothing # mac addressing
&#160;&#160;&#160;nothing # radio
}
start hello
</pre>

<p>Every configuration definition consists of 7 parameters:
<ul>
<li>application module name
<li>network module name
<li>addressing module name supporting network module
<li>quality of information module
<li>mac module name
<li>addressing module name supporting mac module 
<li>radio driver module name
</ul>

The absence of a module is denoted with keyword <b>nothing</b> or <b>none</b>.
</p>

<b>Compilation and Installation</b>

<p>
An SF program is stored in a file with extention <b>.sfp</b>. For example,
the code above could be stored in a file called <b>first_hello.sfp</b>
</p>

<p>
To compile a SF program, use <b>sfc</b> command, for example:
</p>

<pre>
$ sfc first_hello.sfp
</pre>

<p>or simply</p>

<pre>
$ sfc first_hello
</pre>

<p>
which compiles SF program from first_hello.sfp file into nesC code
that is further linked with FF libraries.
</p>

<p>
Next, use <b>fennec</b> command to further compile the nesC code into 
machine code for specific architecture:
</p>

<pre>
$ fennec telosb
</pre>

<p>
for telosB motes, or for intelMote2
</p>

<pre>
$ fennec intelMote2
</pre>

<p>
To compile and install of telosb, add the <b>install</b> parameter
</p>

<pre>
$ fennec telosb install,13
</pre>

<p>
to install on telosb and to give mote address #13
</p>

<p>
Instead of running the code on hardware, the code can be simulated
in CapeFox. To compile the code into CF, pass the <b>cape</b> parameter.
For example:
</p>

<pre>
$ fennec micaz cape
</pre>

<b>Library Modules</b>

<p>
Each configuration definition consists of a list of modules, each
one providing different service and taking various parameters. One can 
think about those modules as of libraries that exist in other languages. 
In other languages a programmer can write a complete program without using
any supporting libraries, or may refer to existing libraries and call
them when necessary, as long as the libraries names and function signatures
are known. 
</p>

<p>
One way to learn about libraries of modules is to read the FF documentation.
However, someone may be interested in not only understanding the high-level
module API, but to also read the underlying nesC code implementing module service.
To find the location of the module nesC code, edit the file 
<b>$FENNEC_FOX_LIB/support/sfc/fennec.sfl</b> consisting of a list of
library modules visible to Swift Fox compiler. A sample few lines of this
file are pasted below:
</p>

<pre>
# Standard Fennec Fox Applications
use application blink $(FENNEC_FOX_LIB)/Application/Blink
use application new_app /home/user/NewApp

# Standard Fennec Fox Network Protocols
use network broadcast $(FENNEC_FOX_LIB)/Network/broadcast

# Addressing
use address fixed $(FENNEC_FOX_LIB)/Addressing/Fixed
</pre>

<p>
For example, the line
</p>

<pre>
use application blink $(FENNEC_FOX_LIB)/Application/Blink
</pre>

<p>
provides a <b>blink</b> tag for application, which nesC code is stored in 
<b>$(FENNEC_FOX_LIB)/Application/Blink</b>. More over, SF excepts to
see the configuration definition of the blink module in file Blink<b>AppC.nc</b>.
For example, to see the underlying nesC code executing <b>blink</b> module, we could do:
</p>

<pre>
$ more $FENNEC_FOX_LIB/Application/Blink/BlinkAppC.nc
</pre>

<p>
seeing some fragments of the code:
</p>

<pre>
generic configuration BlinkAppC(uint8_t led, uint16_t delay) {
   provides interface Mgmt;
   provides interface Module;
   uses interface NetworkCall;
   uses interface NetworkSignal;
}

implementation {
   components new BlinkAppP(led, delay);
   Mgmt = BlinkAppP;
   Module = BlinkAppP;
   NetworkCall = BlinkAppP;
...
</pre>

<p>
As application modules have extention <b>App</b>, similarly, 
the <b>broadcast</b> module is expected to be located in 
broadcast<b>NetC.nc</b> and the <b>fixed</b> module in Fixed<b>AddrC.nc</b>.
Modules implementing MAC and Radio functionality has extentions <b>Mac</b> 
and <b>Radio</b> respectively.
</p>

<p>
In a similar way a library name is traslated into a location of a nesC code,
new FF modules can be added to SF library. For example, a FF application called 
<b>Test</b>, which configuration is stored in file <b>TestAppC.nc</b>, that is located
somewhere in <b>/home</b>, say in <b>/home/code</b> would require additional
entry in <b>$(FENNEC_FOX_LIB)/support/sfc/fennec.sfl</b> to be visible in SF program:
</p>

<pre>
# Adding new Test Application
use application <b>newTest</b> /home/code/<b>Test</b>
</pre>

<p>
If the Test module, which configuration is stored in /home/code/Test/TestAppC.nc file
takes 3 parameters, say par1, par2, par3 and is defined as:
</p>

<pre>
generic configuration TestAppC(uint8_t par1, uint8_t par2, uint8_t par3) {
  provides interface Mgmt;
  provides interface Module;
...
</pre>

<p>
then in SF program we can refer to this module by name <b>newTest</b> followed by
the values of the 3 parameters. For example, a configuration definition would start as 
follows:
</p>

<pre>
configuration conf_name { <b>newTest(1, 2, 3)</b> # the Test application
&#160;&#160;&#160;...
</pre>

<h3>Swift Fox examples</h3>

<b>Null </b><br>

<pre>
# First empty program - btw, this is a comment ;-)
configuration null_conf { nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing}
start null_conf
</pre>

<p>
Instead of keeping everything in one line, we can write it like this:
</p>

<pre>
configuration null_conf { nothing # application
   nothing # network
   nothing # mac
   nothing # radio
}
start null_conf
</pre>

<b>Simple Blinking</b><br>

<pre>
configuration hello { <b>blink(1, 1024)</b> # application
   nothing # network
   nothing # mac
   nothing # radio
}
start hello
</pre>

<b>Sending Counter</b><br>

<pre>
configuration share_counter { <b>counter(2048, 1, 4)</b> # send counter value every 2048ms from node 1 to node 4
   <b>broadcast()</b> &#160;&#160; # simply broadcast the message
   <b>ieee802154(1, 1, 4, 4, 200)</b> # use IEEE 802.15.4 MAC with CCA, ACKnowledgement
   <b>simpleCC2420()</b> # use driver for CC2420
}
start share_counter
</pre>


<h3>History</h3>

<p>
The first idea of a high-level programming language for Fennec Fox platform 
emerged around December 2009. At this time, Fennec Fox (FF) consisted of only two layers: 
Application and Network. Around beginning of February 2010, as part of a
project for class Programming Languages and Translators tought by prof. Alfred Aho,
a group of four students was formed to design and implement the first 
prototype of the Swift Fox compiler. Those students were: Marcin Szczodrak,
Vasileios P. Kemerlis, Xuan Linh Vu, and Yiwei Gu.
</p>

<p>
Over the following months, Fennec Fox network protocol stack has been growing,
untill a point, where the stack consisted of four layers: Application, Network,
MAC, and Radio. By the end of 2010, Swift Fox was supporting all the layers of
the Fennec Fox stack, and allowed to specify addressing scheme supporting
network and MAC protocols. 
</p>

<p>
During CPSWeek conference taking place in Chicago (April 2011), Marcin
discussed with Om the Fennec Fox architecture and the Swift Fox programming
language. Om has suggested to extend Swift Fox such that each module 
of a FF configuration could be parameterized. On August 11, 2011, the first
version of the SF compiler supporting modules parameterization was released.
